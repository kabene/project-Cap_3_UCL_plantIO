PROJECT TITLE:Cap3_SMART
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:Telegram Bot to manage plants, run on a raspberry pi independently with the python script  and arduino 
VERSION or DATE:November 2017
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:first open the project into a JAVA ide,
2) ask for a API key to telegram (easy and automatic) and run this,
3) make a JAR (java executable) put this into a lib repo inside your project to be clever,
4) put the project into your Raspberry with an OS (I recomand NOObOS),
5) run at your bashrc boot or  bash profile  user(nano ~/.bash_profile) then launch the 2 executable, first the python script and the the JAR file to start at the machine boot 
6) ulpoad the raspberry code to a raspberry with a photosensor
7) connect your arduino to your raspberry and start 
8) connect your device to the telegram bot then everything should be ok

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
it could exist some bugs into the predicition part (obviously for a good regression your program should turn during many days)
